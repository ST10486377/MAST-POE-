## üçΩÔ∏è Christoffel's Menu Manager (React Native)
Portfolio of Evidence ‚Äì Part 2
Student: Njabulo Ndlovu
Project: Menu Management App for Chef Christoffel
Technology: React Native (TypeScript) with Expo
## üßæ Project Overview
Christoffel is a private chef known for his personalised dining experiences. He requires a cross-platform mobile application to manage and update his menu quickly before each event.

This React Native application acts as a digital menu manager, allowing the chef to easily add, view, and manage menu items such as starters, mains, and desserts.

This version covers Part 2 of the Portfolio of Evidence ‚Äî building the basic user interface and logic using React Native components and TypeScript.
üß© Features Implemented (Part 2)
‚Ä¢	 Add new menu items by entering: Dish name, Description, Course (Starter/Main/Dessert), and Price
‚Ä¢	 Predefined course list (Starter, Main, Dessert)
‚Ä¢	 Home screen displays all added menu items and total number of menu items
‚Ä¢	 Data stored in an array (not hardcoded, not persistent)
‚Ä¢	 Simple validation and interactive design
‚Ä¢	 Basic animation for better user experience
### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
React Native: Core framework for cross-platform mobile apps
Expo CLI: Simplifies development and running on Android/iOS
TypeScript: Adds type safety and better code structure
VS Code: Code editor
Expo Go App: For testing the app on mobile devices
## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup (Windows)
‚Ä¢ Install Node.js (LTS) from https://nodejs.org/
‚Ä¢ Install Visual Studio Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/
‚Ä¢ Install Expo Go app from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store
‚Ä¢ Optional: Install Git from https://git-scm.com/
‚Ä¢ Create a new Expo project:
